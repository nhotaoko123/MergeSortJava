# Merge Sort in Java

This repository contains an implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in Java. Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the sorted array.

## Features

- **Efficient Sorting**: Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for large datasets.
- **Stable Sort**: Maintains the relative order of equal elements.
- **Recursive Implementation**: The algorithm is implemented using recursion.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code, you need to have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a text editor with Java support (e.g., VS Code)
